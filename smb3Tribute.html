			<p>Almost thirty years after its initial release for the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Mario Bros. 3 remains one of the most revered titles in gaming history.  Rated #6 on <a href="https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-games">IGN’s list of the 100 greatest video games of all time</a>, it is not difficult to see why the game’s legacy has endured.</p>

			<p>The game, at the time, was revolutionary.  Not only did it boast some of the best graphics ever seen on an NES game, but its game play offered a level of depth and richness that was unparalleled to any other title at the time.  Mario could navigate through eight distinct worlds, each with its own quirks and characteristics.  Aiding players on their journey was the vast collection of items that could be obtained along the way such as frog suits, clouds, P-wings, and anchors. </p>

			<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._3#Sales">its Wikipedia entry</a>, Super Mario Brothers 3 sold 250,000 copies in its first week alone, and by 1993, had sold over 7 million copies in the United States alone.  It is currently the highest grossing video game ever, having grossed $1.7 Billion, adjusted for inflation.</p>
